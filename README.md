The need for efficient flood evacuation strategies is escalating due to the escalating climatic
variability and expanding urbanisation. This dissertation addresses the issue of
improving flood evacuation tactics in limited spaces, namely subterranean tube networks.
The paper presents a novel simulation framework that integrates Artificial Intelligence
(AI) for decision-making and optimisation through the use of Agent-Based Simulation
(ABS). The simulation frameworkâ€™s design is built upon the principles of Engineering
Agent-Based Social Simulation (EABSS), which offers a solid foundation and conceptual
framework for simulating realistic and dynamic social interactions.
The integration of the Social Force Model (SFM) is employed in the AI component to
simulate human behaviour and population dynamics in the context of flood occurrences.
The GAMA modelling platform is employed to create a fundamental flood simulation
within an underground tube network, which serves as a testing ground for the implementation
of AI logic based on SFM. The solution allows the agents within the simulation to
not only adhere to established evacuation protocols but also adjust and make judgements
in response to real-time circumstances. Through the incorporation of various methodologies,
the framework offers intricate observations on the effectiveness of existing evacuation
procedures and highlights potential avenues for improvement, thus facilitating the development
of more sophisticated and adaptable approaches.
